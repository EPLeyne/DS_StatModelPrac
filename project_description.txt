The Mulligans Flat woodland sanctuary is managed by the ACT Parks & Wildlife, where Adrian Manning from ANU already had some sites marked out in the yellow box woodland. Each site had a number of different elements (tree, old logs, dispersed logs, top of clumped logs, bottom of clumped logs, & open grassland). Gordon McLachlan collected the field data with the assistance of John Gillen and Pauline Molinier. Soil water infiltration was measured with disc permeameters. A saturated disc permeameter suspended over ring 1cm deep of water for the +1cm readings, and unsaturated disc permeameter on a thin layer of fine Bungendore sand as a contact material for the -1cm & -4cm readings. Data was recorded on the paper datasheets in the field and then entered in the excel data sheet back at the lab. Bulk density cores were hit into the ground and trimmed & wrapped to retain moisture in the field. At the lab these were unwrapped, weighed & dried in a 105oC oven and weighed again. The weights & core dimensions were recorded in the excel file with other data. Gordon McLachlan did the lab work and data entry into the excel file where the results were graphed.
